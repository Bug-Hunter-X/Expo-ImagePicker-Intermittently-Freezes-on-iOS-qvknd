# Expo ImagePicker Freezing Issue on iOS

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the Expo ImagePicker library on iOS devices. The image selection process would freeze or stop unexpectedly, making it difficult to use the library reliably.

## Problem Description

The ImagePicker component from Expo would sometimes freeze during the image selection process. This issue occurred inconsistently and was particularly challenging to debug due to its sporadic nature.  Specific steps to reproduce the issue were not consistently identifiable.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the ImagePicker's usage and ensuring proper error handling.  We will implement more robust error handling to catch and log errors gracefully, and to prevent the application from completely freezing.

## How to Reproduce

While the exact conditions for reproduction remain elusive, users are encouraged to explore this code base to test the reported behavior on their iOS device.

## Additional Notes

- This issue was specific to iOS. It did not present itself on Android devices during testing.
- Future improvements might involve stricter checks and logging within the Expo ImagePicker component's internal processes to pinpoint the root of the inconsistency.
